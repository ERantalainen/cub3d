Hive Helsinki project, done with C and the MLX42 library by Codam. The "3d" environment is implemented using raycasting with the DDA algorithm. The core task is to just make a walkable environment with raycasted walls, colored floor and ceiling. This project includes additional features, while a lot of the additional work is not visible on the surface, a great deal of work went into multithreading the program to optimize it.

Core features:

- WASD Movement
- Arrow key camera control
- Mouse Based camera control
- Minimap
- Compass / Direction indicator
- FPS counter

Bonus features:

- Multithreaded RayCasting algorithm for improved performance
- Textured floors and ceilings
